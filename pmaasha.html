          • The Union Cabinet approved a new Umbrella Scheme
          “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay
          SanraksHan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA). The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018.<br>
          • The umbrella scheme ‘PM-AASHA’ comprises three sub-schemes:<br>
          o Price Support Scheme (PSS).<br>
          o Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS).<br>
          o Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPPS).<br>
          • Price Support Scheme (PSS):<br>
          o Under the scheme, the physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds and
          Copra will be done by Central Nodal Agencies with the proactive role of
          the state governments.<br>
          o Further, in addition to NAFED, the Food Cooperation of India (FCI) will
          take up PSS operations in states and districts.<br>
          o The procurement expenditure and losses due to procurement will be
          borne by the Union Government as per norms.<br>
          • Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS):<br>
          o Under the scheme, it is proposed to cover all oilseeds for which
          minimum support price (MSP) is notified.<br>
          o In this, direct payment of the difference between the MSP and the
          selling/modal price will be made to pre-registered farmers selling his
          produce in the notified market yard through a transparent auction
          process.<br>
          o All payments will be done directly into the registered bank account of
          the farmer.<br>
          o This scheme does not involve any physical procurement of crops as
          farmers are paid the difference between the MSP price and sale or
          modal price on disposal in the notified market.<br>
          • Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPPS):<br>
          o For oilseeds, the states will have the option to roll out Private
          Procurement Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in selected districts
          and Agricultural Produce Market Committee’s (APMC) of district
          involving the participation of private stockiest.<br>
          o The pilot district and selected APMC(s) will cover one or more crop of
          oilseeds for which MSP is notified.<br>
          o Since this is similar to the PSS scheme, as it involves physical
          procurement of the notified commodity, the scheme shall substitute
          PSS/PDPS in the pilot districts.<br>
          o The selected private agency shall procure the commodity at MSP in the
          notified markets during the notified period from the registered farmers
          in accordance with the PPSS Guidelines, whenever the prices in the
          market fall below the notified MSP and whenever authorised by the
          state or UT government to enter the market. The maximum service
          charges up to 15% of the notified MSP will be payable.<br>
