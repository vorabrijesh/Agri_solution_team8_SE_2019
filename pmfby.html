          • Parliament’s committee on estimates has in its latest report called for re-
          formulation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), seeking
          transparency in its working and asking for more financial allocations to attract
          increasing participation from farmers.<br>
          • The committee has observed that there are fundamental flaws in the design of
          the scheme that renders it rather ineffective.<br>
          • Background:<br>
          o Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), launched in 2016, has run
          into rough weather. With both the area covered and the number of
          enrolled farmers declining, the country’s premium crop insurance
          scheme is certainly in need of an overhaul.<br>
          • About PMFBY:<br>
          o In April, 2016, the government of India had launched Pradhan Mantri
          Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) after rolling back the earlier insurance
          schemes viz. National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS), Weather-
          based Crop Insurance scheme and Modified National Agricultural
          Insurance Scheme (MNAIS).<br>
          o Premium: It envisages a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by
          farmers for Kharif crops, and 1.5% for Rabi crops. The premium for
          annual commercial and horticultural crops will be 5%.<br>
          o The difference between premium and the rate of insurance charges
          payable by farmers is provided as subsidy and shared equally by the
          Centre and State.<br>
          o The scheme is mandatory for farmers who have taken institutional
          loans from banks. It’s optional for farmers who have not taken
          institutional credit.<br>
          • Objectives:<br>
          o Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage
          arising out of unforeseen events.<br>
          o Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.<br>
      

          o Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural
          practices.<br>
          o Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector.<br>
          • Gram Sabhas across the country have been asked to inform the farmers about
          the enrolment and benefits of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) at the
          beginning of the Rabi Season.<br>
          • Union Government has decided to cover damages to crops in wild animal
          attacks under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna in select districts on an
          experimental basis.<br>
          o In this regard, Government has amended provisions of crop insurance
          scheme in consultation with various stakeholders. The amended
          provisions of the scheme have been implemented from October 2018.<br>
          o As per the new provisions:<br>
          ▪ Certain horticultural crops have been brought under ambit of
          PMFBY on experimental basis.<br>
          ▪ Damages due to individual fields due to incidents of localised
          disasters like water logging, land slide, cloud bursts, hailstorms
          and fire too are brought under scheme.<br>
          ▪ Henceforth, insurances firms will also have to spend 0.5% of
          their earnings from annual premium to advertise provisions of
          the scheme.<br>
          ▪ Fines in cases of delay in clearing insurance claims for crop
          damages have been proposed.<br>
          ▪ In case firm delays insurance clearances beyond two months, it
          will have to pay an annual interest of 12%.<br>
          ▪ Similarly, State government too will have to pay interest of 12%
          in case of delay in release of state’s share of subsidy in premium
          to insurance firms.<br>
